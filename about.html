            <h2 style="margin: 0">(2004, Based in Rotterdam)</h2><br><br>
            <p>Photography has always been a part of my life. As a child, I was fascinated by cameras, video editing, and photo manipulation. Anything that allowed me to capture and create. My journey began when I found my mother’s camera, long forgotten and collecting dust. Since then, I’ve been exploring photography in all its forms, from studio portraits to impressive landscapes.<br><br>
                
                My work is broad and ever evolving, refusing to be confined to a single style. I enjoy capturing strong, iconic portraits that reflect the personality of my subjects, but I also experiment with landscapes, social documentary, and commercial photography. Whether working digitally or embracing analog film and printing techniques, I am constantly learning, refining, and expanding my creative practice.<br><br>
                
                Beyond photography, I integrate graphic design and creative coding into my work. I’ve designed posters, created publications, and built my own portfolio website from scratch. One of my projects explored social media addiction (<a style="color: #6a03f2" href="escape_s_b.html">Escape the skinner box</a>), where I combined my photography archive with typography and design to craft an engaging publication. This approach allows me to not only capture visuals but also shape narratives and stories in exciting ways.<br><br>
                
                As a queer artist, my work is often deeply personal. Photography has become a way to document my journey of self-acceptance and explore themes of identity. Growing up queer in a small town has shaped my perspective and fueled my interest in art that challenges norms. While my work leans more toward cinematic storytelling than activism, I hope to create projects in the future that spark conversation and raise awareness for underrepresented topics.<br><br>
                
                Color and aesthetics play a big role in my photography. Sometimes, I use bright, flashy visuals to make a statement; other times, my choices are intuitive, reflecting my personality and the mood of a photo or scene. Ultimately, I want my work to amaze, surprise, and impress. I want people to feel something, whether that’s curiosity, admiration, or a sense of connection.<br><br>
                
                I bring a broad creative skillset to my work, ranging from studio and outdoor photography to film development, creative coding, bookbinding, and publication design. I want potential clients to see the value in my aesthetic and way of working. While I’m adaptable to commercial work, I strive to collaborate with those who appreciate my artistic vision.<br><br>
                
                My inspirations are rooted in technology, video games, and electronic music—mediums that influence the way I see and construct images. As I move forward, I want to create projects that go beyond the visual and contribute to meaningful discussions. I don’t believe in pinning down a singular message in my work because I’m always evolving. My artistic expression will continue to shift and grow, reflecting not just who I am, but the world as I experience it.
